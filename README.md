# vsFTPd 2.3.4 Backdoor Exploit
Overview

This tool exploits a well-known backdoor vulnerability found in vsFTPd version 2.3.4. The vulnerability allows attackers to gain unauthorized shell access to the target system by sending specially crafted input to the FTP service. This exploit takes advantage of a malicious backdoor that was intentionally introduced in version 2.3.4, which opens a listening port (6200) after receiving a certain payload.

Note: This vulnerability is specific to version 2.3.4 of vsFTPd. Attempting to use this tool on other versions will result in failure.

## Vulnerability Explanation

The vulnerability arises due to a backdoor that was deliberately added to the vsFTPd 2.3.4 distribution in June 2011. When a maliciously crafted username (with a `:)` at the end) is sent to the FTP server, it triggers the backdoor, causing the server to open a shell on port 6200. Attackers can then connect to this port and gain shell access to the system.

# Why This Vulnerability Exists

The vulnerability in vsFTPd 2.3.4 was introduced by an unknown attacker who uploaded a modified version of the source code to the official vsFTPd download server. This backdoored version was available for a short time before it was detected and removed. However, any system that installed vsFTPd during that period is vulnerable if they are still running version 2.3.4.
